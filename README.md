Cross-Asset Analysis Potential, Anomaly Detection and Forecasting on commodities (Natural Gas ; Gold ; Brent Crude Oil ; Aluminium ; Wheat) between 2000 and 2023

For the purposes of our research, we have chosen a dataset of futures prices for various commodities. We selected five items from the available set, chosen for their economic relevance and sectoral diversity. The data covers the period from January 1, 2000 to August 4, 2023. This 23-year period is able to capture macroeconomic cycles, geopolitical and energy disruptions, as well as structural changes such as the ecological transition. These options guarantee a broad enough historical scope to examine underlying trends, sector fluctuations and possible correlations between these commodities. 

**Time Series Selection:**

Commodities Time Series Dataset, focusing on Natural Gas, Gold, Brent Crude, Aluminium, and Wheat. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.

These commodities are key indicators of global economic health: 

- **Natural Gas** reflects energy supply/demand dynamics and seasonality.  

- **Gold** is a defensive asset, sensitive to inflation and geopolitical risks.  

- **Brent Crude** represents global oil prices and consumptions, vital for inflation and growth forecasts. 

- **Aluminium** is crucial in manufacturing and construction.  

- **Wheat** prices affect global food security.  

**Volatility and Forecastability**: Commodities exhibit strong seasonality, high volatility, and complex correlations, making them ideal for:  

- **Anomaly detection** (geopolitical or political disruptions)  

- **Forecasting** (cyclicality, patterns demand/supply trends using time series models)  

- **Cross-Asset Analysis Potential**: The dataset allows for studying relationships (correlations, how oil shocks impact gold or wheat) and looking at potential risks.
